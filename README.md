# VectorTools
A didactical project that aims to give basic tools to draw vectors and operate on them in maya.  
This plugin comprehends: 
- A locator node that draws a vector from two points in the space 
- A context tool that creates the locator node with two locator connected to its input attribute ( based on maya Measure Distance tool )
- Two utility nodes that performs basic vector operations. One for Vector-scalar computation. and one for Vector-Vector computations.
